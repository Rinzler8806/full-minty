Select how many NFTs you would like to mint (between 1 and 3) and click MINT NOW. You will receive a prompt from your wallet to confirm the charge. Once the charge is confirmed you will see the transaction complete for your Mint.

The app utilizes React, Metamask, rinkeby test network, Ethers, ChakraUI, and OpenZeppelin. For smart contract testing Hardhat (https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) was utilized.
